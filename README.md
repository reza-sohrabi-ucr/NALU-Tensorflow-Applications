# NALU-Tensorflow-Applications
Neural Arithmetic Logic Unit (NALU) implementation in Tensorflow and some of its applications based on this
[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.00508.pdf). The architecture of the their proposed model is depicted in the figure below.

In different notebooks, I will explore the applications of this model in different tasks.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
The first task was to see if the network can extrapolate the addition of numbers in the range it has not been trained on, which results in 0 error.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This is a work in progress, and I will explore other tasks soon.
